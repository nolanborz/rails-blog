# README

This is a personal website I made for myself using Ruby on Rails. It includes an About Me page,
a Work page, a Blog page, and a Login page for admin access. The About Me and Work pages are pretty
static as there isn't anything to interact with, but the Blog section houses articles I've written,
both published posts and drafts. It also includes a writing interface where I (the admin) can write,
style, and even edit each post. It's insanely simple by design, and serves as a place where people can
get to know a little about me, can see some samples of my work, and can read a little into what goes on
in my mind through my blog posts.
