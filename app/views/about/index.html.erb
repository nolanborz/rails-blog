    <p class="mb-4">Hello there!</p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      My name is Nolan, I'm a Software Engineer living in Hokkaido, Japan.
      I'm from Utah, USA, and graduated from the University of Utah with a
      Bachelors of Arts in Japanese. In 2022 I was accepted into the JET (Japan Exchange Teaching)
      Program, and have spent the last 3 years teaching English in Japan.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      In March of 2024, I decided to invest in myself by learning actual skills I could put towards a career
      which would take me where I wanted to go. I discovered an open-source, full-stack curriculum
      called <a href="https://theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>, and used it to gain strong fundamentals and experience
      in web development. It's also where I was introduced to Ruby on Rails, and since then I've never looked back.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">My thoughts on programming after one year? It's awesome. I love figuring out how things work and building
      apps, and am eager to create applications which solves problems in a simple, efficient, understandable way.</p>
